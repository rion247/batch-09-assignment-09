## About This Website:
Residential real estate includes individual single-family detached homes,townhouses, apartments, student housing, senior living communities, vacation rentals and multi-family attached units sharing at least one wall. It stands as the largest sector in the real estate market, constituting over 75% of global real estate values in both size and value.

Although the average value of a home is less than that of an office building, the total space required for residential purposes, accommodating people, is much larger compared to the space needed for office use and retail shopping.
